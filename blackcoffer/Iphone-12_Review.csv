0,Yaswanth S.,An overall good premium experience,3.0,"SUMMERY: As a first time iPhone user, I would say one should definitely buy iPhone ONLY for premium built & premium hardware (will talk later) while the whole iOS experience is pretty overrated. iPhones isn't any exceptionally fast with normal apps like YouTube, Insta etc, Android phones are equally snappy with them in 2022.PROS:1. Impressive hardware, the heptics, the autobrightness & otherwise highly ignored things in Android are way too perfectly executed in iPhone and it DOES make a big difference in user experience!!2. The screen is AMAZING.. it doesn't have 90 or 120 hz refresh rate but it FEELS better than my Nord with 90 hz!!3. A14 bionic promises years of performance ahead.4. Battery life is somewhere in between good & great.5.6. The dimensions of phone, it's smaller than usual android phones and feels much more handy along with less weight.7. Overall build quality is great.8. Best audio output out there.9. Long term support.CONS:1. SLOW CHARGING. 20 W only, you'll be jealous of 1/3rd price phones with 60 W charging. Yes that much high charging will effect health of battery but 20 W is way way too less, if Apple is such a legendary company they should have created a battery that can withstand decently fast charging while instead they just use slow charging to keep their battery's health.2. Overy exhagerated software experience, reality is that Android is more user friendly with better gesture & commonsense options & settings & steps to do simple things. iOS looks pretty yes but UX engineers at Apple have really done a crappy job.. there's still no notification grouping in correct manner (its executed poorly), no proper homescreen customisation & just so so so many ""commonsense"" things are missing from iOS I can rant all day about it. Everything you can do in Android with a single click or swipe takes 2 swipes and then a click to do in iOS its SOOOOO ANNOYING. Like you want to clear a notification? Swipe and then click on clear. You want to open a notification? Swipe FIRST and then click open.. like wth????????3. DON'T believe Apple fanboys who scream about speed, Android phones are equally snappy in performance today. There are split second app loading times in iOS also, just like in Android. And yeah iOS DOES HAVE occasional bugs too, apps taking too much time sometimes etc etc.4. FaceID is nice but an in-fingerprint reader seems the best ID to me atleast, that's missing.5. Ridiculously expensive accessories6. Battery life is above good but not great.In the end I would say iPhone, overall, does provide a better experience (mostly cuz of hardware only) but it's expensive. Do know that you're NOT buying a value-for-money phone at all, so buy it only if you can afford it without much difficulty."
1,Navish Paik,Excellent product,4.0,Satisfied with the quality and performance but it's battery drains quickly.
2,Mantu  kumar,In the era of 14 this is still beast,4.0,"Using for few months, no heating issue, but night camera is worst."
3,Yogesh Kumar Sharma,mujhe acha laga istmal kar ke,4.0,In 2022 best iPhone ever
4,Swapnil S Joshi,iphone 12 is good for normal use but don‚Äôt expect wow factor from this device.,4.0,"Whereas brand is apple, you can expect standard handset which it should be. Camera is good, display is good, sound is good, battery is average indeed.  I can not recommend this handset for gamers or heavy users, normal user can use this handset, no problem set"
5,Jaimica Raval,Review,4.0,Cost to much high as per proformance
6,Yaswanth S.,Great product,3.0,"This is not the first iPhone, so nothing more to review on iOS or iPhone, but something specific to this phone/ experience is jotted below.1. I upgraded from iPhone SE (1st gen) to this one. The migration was super smooth. Just power on and keep besides the old phone, in almost 30mins you are done. Everything including apps and app settings are migrated.2. Camera is really great.3. I wanted a small set, I guess iPhone 12 mini would have been an ideal choice. However, this is not bad, either."
7,Nazimulla Alam Khan,Good and satisfactory upgrade for user having iphone series before 12,4.0,Face scan unlock is perfect
8,Jaskarn singh,Honest review after 30-40 Days,4.0,"Switched to IOS for the first time, was really very excited to get the iphone 12.Display is stunning but might feel small if ur switching from a 6.5inch androidSpeakers are amazing they are loud, clear and have dolby effects.Build quality is superb which is expected from appleFace id might sound a bit concerning but its well integrated and works flawlessly.Camera is simply superb for a 2020 phone the video quality is unmatched.Haptics are flagship level.Cons-battery isnt that good and needs to be charged once a day at the least sometimes even 2 times.no charger in box had to purchase 20w charger for 1.8kprovided cable doesnt feel very sturdyIOS 16 is filled with bugs and degraded battery life compared to ios 15( at the time of review)The network reception isnt that great (cellular) wifi is great"

It gets warm sometimes. Charging speed is fine. I wont recommend it for gaming.iPhones are on the pricier side but I am expecting long term use with the same snappier feel and less bugs.
18,Yaswanth S.,Premium phone with poor battery and average camera,3.0,I have upgraded from four years old iPhone 7.Only noticeable change is screen size and face unlocking.Camera doesn‚Äôt adjust exposure properly and I must say not much better from iPhone7.Let‚Äôs bear this for next 4-5 years üòä

25,Ankit,BEST price,4.0,

27,Senthilkumar M,A great smartphone!,5.0,"Loved this phone. Got it only for 45k during the sale.  Camera quality, built quality, everything is great. Though not fond of the battery backup, I guess that‚Äôs a problem with every iPhone."

32,Praveen S B,Beyond Expectations,4.0,"With soo many innovations in Iphone series, i did not expect this one to be soo great.I love it, the midnight black colour is lovely. With the Face ID features and quick access to all the apps in App Store, this series is a must buy."
33,sangam pandey,Happy,4.0,Migrating from iPhone SE first generation to iPhone 12. Pleasant experience. One star less why because delivery was inordinately delayed.
34,Niyaz Ahmed jahagirdar ,If you get iphone 12 for around 42000 then go for it.,5.0,"I purchased iphone 12 in great Indian festival sale for 41500 excluding charger. Camera quality 5/5 , Battery 4.5/5(used you tube, Netflix, safari for anime, ig, whatsApp and battery lasted 1 1/2 day). Os is so smooth and easy to use. No blotware so big thumbs up. Got ios update16.1 . Build quality feels premium. (In hand use without back cover feels so good that i cannot explain). Iphone 12 is slightly lighter in weight.I even played apex legends and fps was constant, no lag,no heating issue. Hdr content is top notch. Plus it's 5g so I can easily use it for more than 5yrs.Overall after using iphone 12 for around 2months i can say it is worth it. Overall experience 5/5"
35,Dr Kulmohan S Mehta,Best Iphone,4.0,"Phones been amazingI have used iphone 4s , 5 , 6s and xr but I liked it.Long battery life, not quite as good as iPhone 13 but Close. Plus I didn‚Äôt like the weight and thickness of iPhone 13  just to get maybe 45-60 minutes more time at the most. I don‚Äôt see any difference in speed between Bionic14 and Bionic 15 what so ever. And to much hype for the 120 h refresh rate, no noticeable difference at all. Also I actually think iPhone 12 pictures look better than iPhone 13 because by supposedly having slight bit more detail they over saturate the black in them. Love the thin weightless feel in iPhone 12 and have had zero issues. I‚Äôm keeping this phone till the wheels fall off. Great value."

42,Yaswanth S.,Excellent Phone,3.0,Battery life is poor. No VoLTE calling. Excellent camera.
43,ARIF N K,iPhone is the standard against which all smartphones are compared,5.0,"I purchased this phone for my wife. Last year I purchased iPhone X for my son who is currently in the UK. I own an iPad and iMac 27"". I am not going to buy an iPhone for myself - at least not yet. One of the main things that I don't like about Android phones is the crap (bloatware) that each maker puts in. Moto and Google Pixel come with pure stock Android. So those can be left out. So I wanted a good phone for my wife so that she could FaceTime with my son in the UK anytime.What is there to say? So many have written about it. Since everyone writes all the positives, I will write some negatives. While there aren't too many, no product can be perfect:1. Brings in all the junk from the old phone. If one is switching from Android to iPhone, the ""Move to iOS"" app on Android can help. However be sure to clean up your Android phone first else all junk (especially ""Good Morning"", ""Good day"" picture crap from WhatsApp photos). Be sure to clean the SMS inbox also, especially all those blocked and spam messages which may be hidden from the main view and we never know that exist.2. WhatsApp cannot be synced. Yes, there are 3rd party apps but they are full of ad-crap and I can't trust them for security.3. Difficulty in validating iMessage and FaceTime. I could not activate iMessage and FaceTime with my mobile number. I simply could not figure this out. This is the case with my Vodaphone SIM/Number in India. Only when I added my email to my Apple ID, the two apps started working. Even now, the mobile number is not verified.4. I wish Apple provides dual SIM. Now dual SIM is almost a necessity. But as my wife does not use two SIMs, for her, it is fine.5. Apple is providing USB-C to lightning cable. They should supply USB-A to lightning cable instead. 99% of the chargers have a USB-A output. I had to purchase a USB-A to USB-C mini adapter (‚Çπ180) for this, or someone may have to buy a cable of the type (good cables from Apple, Belkin, Anker cost ‚Çπ1100 and above). By far, this is my biggest grouse.6. This is not the latest iPhone. The iPhone 13 was ‚Çπ73,000 and did not seem VFM. Even at ‚Çπ56,000 (‚Çπ55,900 to be exact), the iPhone12 may not be money best spent. This is one reason, why I haven't purchased an iPhone for myself all this while (I can afford to buy the latest one every year)."

72,Yaswanth S.,An overpriced Average product,3.0,"I wanted to explore how good is Apple compared to Android. I must say the only good thing about this is consistency in both cameras and various different lightings. However on a number of occasions it does make you look darker than what ever you are. I find more cons tha pros so here is a list1. Network connectivity and wifi is not upto the mark. My OnePlus 9 pro will have better coverage with same wifi and network.2. At this exorbitant price, it's painful to see 60hz screen. You would find the scrolling painfully slow.3. Every accessory is expensive and the quality of these accesories is not something out of the world.4. The charging speed is really slow. Some claim fast chargers ruin the battery. But i had OnePlus phones easily lasting 3 plus of battery with fast charge. Have seen couple of iPhones draining battery within 2 years. My friends have iPhone 11 which i am referring to.5. Lack of customisation and the same boring look of the icons and you need to search numerous things to share anything.6. Face ID gets annoying at times. You need to also have other ways like fingerprint apart from passcode to unlock when u want to answer video calls.7. The nasty notch. I dont know if apple needs another decade to remove this. The new series pill shape is not either the best looking.8. Lock into the ecosystem and lack of flexibility."

76,Juel sk,Good phone,5.0,"It‚Äôs good phone but for the new user, especially android user it‚Äôs difficult to use for few days.Apple does not provide any accessoriesThe cable it provides doesn‚Äôt work on normal adopter.

A better quality phone can be purchased in this budget but when you enter in to the Apple Eco-System, it suck you in like anything and you have to buy their products.Let's hope Apple will better their offering to thwart the competitionb otherwise one day a better brand can eat their pie."

123,Pallavee,Somehow Returned this,5.0,"I got this product on 20th April 2022 and returned it on 28th April 2022 haha, with so much excitement I opened the product and started using it, since I was an Android to iOS user I did find some difficulties in using it but it was fine. The real problem started while using it,The Phone started to overheat for minimal usages, I'd call for 5 to 10 minutes hands would be burning with phone heat, 15 minutes of social media again hands would be burning hot, I didn't get any temperature warning but heat was hot enuf for me to keep it aside for a long period of time, Due to overheat the battery used to die fast and I would hv required to charge it thrice a day. I roamed around the Apple authorized service centres and so many calls to Amazon for a replacement but nobody seems to give me any solution, then I thought I'll just use it, but again it started getting worse and I called Apple and they said to give my phone to service centre for 7 to 10 days so they can diagnosis be done and find out issue while I survive 7 to 10 days without a phone haha, then I couldn't take it anymore as I understood if I continue using this phone I wouldn't get 4 weeks yet alone 4 years and pleaded to Amazon coz I am a prime member ever since prime was out and I have ordered tons and tons of products in Amazon and never faced this issue.But the hard earned money going like this was hurting so I submitted whatever documents Amazon asked me to get from Apple and finally they gave me return for this product.The item has been returned and get to reach their warehouse which then oly I will get my refund initiated which is gonna take another 15 to 20 days, but I'm fine since I can wait and not lose my hard earned money. For now I hv a 7 year old phone as backup which is working ok ok but I can manage to write atleast this review.So whoever face this issue, and wants a replacement or return please try your best with whatever Amazon asks from you n they will provide a solution.I still need to buy an Apple phone next coz I bought the 2k adapter and it's return period got over haha.Anyways the Phone was amazing to use,So performance wise 5/5Camera was just amazing 5/5Battery tho 1 or 2/5Over heating so -2/5 or 0/5Overall a bad experience but still excited to get apple product.Btw Apple service centres help very well and listen to ur problems and provide solutions properly and handles it well.So if you are getting a iPhone I hope u guys don't face any situation like mine.Thank you n have  a great day :)"

137,sahil sharma,Not Really worth the money,3.0,"I have been an android user for the past 8+ years. Recently was using iphone 6 for the past few months, liked it much and wanted to switch to ios. I did not want to regret, so i purchased the best in the market, going with iphone 12. Honestly, I dont feel its worthy. Perfomance wise, its good. A lot other phones like MI, 1+ everything gives us a very nice perfomance too. The A14 chip is just a tag line to sell the phone. Are we really going to process million instructions per second on a mobile phone? Defenitely not.Battery, After charging it to 100% in the morning, I am hardly getting 1 full day with average use. My battery is almost 20% at the end of the day with a screentime of 4-4.3 hours[Update : With low power mode, it makes a 6 hour day, ending with 30%]. Camera quality is amazing in natural light. Yes, as specified it works so nice in night light, but please dont mistake night light as no-light. Front camera is still average. The same things i see in every other mid range android phones. I am still using JIO 4g. Not sure how this would work on 5g (must drain even faster)Face detenction, the color of the phone, Water resistant and all stuffs are nice to have, fancy items.  But not really convinced if this is all we get for 84k?Fast charging - I bought a 20W charger from apple store for Rs.1900. I plug in when the battery is 20-25% and it takes 1.45 hours to reach 100%. If this is all about fast charging you are looking for, well and good. I never tried with magsafe, honestly. But this to me doesnt seem fast charging for 2800~ mah battery.I wont say that this phone is too poor. It gives us all that it promises. Personally I dont recommend investing 85k Indian money into this. Either go for lower versions of other iphones like 11 or you can wait for an year and buy this at cheaper cost.PROS : Camera & PerfomanceCONS : Battery and Cost"
138,Yaswanth S.,Upgrade from iPhone 7 to iPhone 12 and it‚Äôs worth,3.0,Excellent phone and worth the upgrade from iPhone 7.Pros:Looks slimFlat designBatteryDisplayGreat Indian festival discount came with the price of 41.5k and additional card and exchange discountLooks so premium deviceCons:Amazon delivery took more than 20 days to deliver the phone and that do after continuous follow up over chat and call in the interval of every 2 daysGreat Indian festival Discount products are delivered intentionally late.Next time take a pause before buying in the discount sale and buy or buy from offline store if there is no much price difference

Also the stock keyboard is very small so I use swift keyboard  so if you are planning  for mini  please  reconsider  your  thoughtsPros: Camera, Video, Audio, build quality, DisplayCons: Small keyboard, Going to previous screen is not easy like android, Case cover is must because  smudge comes easy in backside, Little  bit feeling hotter than Android.Update: After using it for a week, the battery is very very bad in ios 16, an android user will not feel good.But I use it on table, so it's not a problem for me. If I decide to use it for outdoor video recording, I'll definetly buy a powerbank, otherwise this will be a disaster."

Initially, I was worried because of the battery life. Because on paper it is just a 2815 mAh battery. But the way the A14 chip manages the performance and battery is spectacular.Cons: No telephone lens. Though I hardly require it (but this is the only cons I think it has)."

It came safely and works well. Always record an unboxing video and ask the derivery person to wait if possible (I didn‚Äôt make him wait in my case, just recorded unboxing). I checked everything and the serial no. on the apple site. I‚Äô gonna use it in my mbbs journey that is about to start soon and I‚Äôm so glad. I was worried first because I had ordered my ipad pro in 2020 from the official site only and I have a hard time trusting online retailers for buying electronics but thankfully it‚Äôs authentic.

Seller please do not do this to any other buyer. It's very disappointing.It got me very worried so i check everything. IMEI, model no., Serial no. on apple website, Siri, etc...

¬†Got this for a friend on the amazon sale for 46.5k. This is the lowest price this model has ever gone down to, so I was a bit skeptical in the beginning(hoping it was not a pile of rocks or a used product). The phone reached on time as promised and was packed well and the box felt solid. The build quality is really good and everything seems to be working fine on switching it on and testing it. If you are in the apple ecosystem, then you will enjoy this phone. But me personally, I appreciate my oneplus 9 pro much more after experiencing the iphone 12 for a while. Enjoy the ASMR unboxing video!"

246,Yaswanth S.,Absolutely loved the phone but price could have been bit cheaper,3.0,"I phone i must say having great optimization of software with hardware, more quality apps are available when compared to google, receiving a file is the only major pain i felt till now,Battery backup is really good 2800 mAh in apple is almost like 5000mAh in android am not kidding, i have rog phone 3 it is 6000 mAh but at the end of the day the i phone has almost same % left, may be it's due to the less hz display.Despite of having 60Hz display it feels goodAnd what can i say the speakers are loud and clear compared with rog 3.45k should have been the right price for 64gb model but for 53k it's not a bad deal either, if you ask me spending 50k for an android is not worth since i phone has all hardware and software superiority.No charger is a big let down by apple. And finally 64gb is good enough if you ask me as most of those having wifi connection can easily upgrade to i cloud paying just 75rs/Month and for the average 3 years of use the price will be still 2700rs in three year. For the 128gb i had to pay 8000rs more so still i am saving around 5300rs if i chose to use i cloud from the starting day.No Finger print sensor , but it's ok the face id does it right but yes the finger print should be good. And for the notch it's ok. I phone 12 and 13 has virtually no difference so y to waste 20k more money buying the 13 just for the bit improvement of camera and brightness, hope you like my review üôÇ"

283,Gobinath,Phone is great but iOS sucks,5.0,"First of all, I don't know why people here are leaving misleading reviews, I didn't feel any sort of heating issue or something like that, neither my phone is damaged nor it is refurbished. These sort of reviews are only making other people sceptical.Now let's talk about the cell phone itself.It is great, I love it. The reason why I gave 3 stars is because I have been an android user before this device and I am being honest right now :-iOS sucks in terms of user experience, Android is easy to use and makes a lot of sense (believe me, I was a hardcore android user, I didn't only use it for playing games and making calls). In iOS I kinda feel like being constraint.let me give you few example, which are quite obvious but still not in iOS:-1. Notifications- You can't reply through notifications.- Notifications from a similar user/ sender do bundle, but you can only see the latest message (You can't just swipe down on notification to preview the messages)- if you want to remove a particular notification then you have to swipe two times to the left. If you swiped right then it will open the message for you (lol).- Notifications are so huge, sometimes it's really painful to scroll through all the notifications.2. App library- It has something called app library, they thought it'd be cool to make one but by giving their own flavor. They bundled things in their respective folder not like in android where each icon represent an app. You have to explicitly click on search(app library) to see all apps in the list view or to search an app. Just copy android, no one is slapping you in the face for that.3. whatsapp- Using whatsapp is really frustating sometimes.- To send some media to a contact, there are three processes. Two times it will do preparing and then one time it will do the sending (finally). if you are sending some big media to someone then you can literally get a 15 min power nap and then grab a cup of coffee and drink it, still there might be chances that the iOS would be in one of the preparing process.- Sometimes when you click on someone's profile then instead of opening the user's profile, whatsapp tends to scroll to the location from where that current day chats are starting (I think that is whatsapp's issue not iOS)- You can't directly send any media as a document (preserving it's quality). There are steps to do that too.The above points are few examples, I will keep updating them as per my experience.I am not saying iOS is slow or the phone's hardware is bad, it's actually quite opposite of bad, it's fast and amazing.I just hated the user experience domain of iOS. It really really sucks. iOS should bluntly copy the android things so that the HARDCORE IPHONE USERS will know what user experience they were missing."

315,Samit M.,Long Term Review: Excellent All Rounder Device,5.0,"This is going to be a long review, sit back, relax and have a read.I bought the iPhone 12 in May of 2021 after selling my OnePlus.Having used the iPhone7 and XR for years, this was my third iPhone.I have to say the iOS experience on the XR was absolutely horrible. Terrible reception, average battery and mediocre cameras forced me to move to android. I was tempted to move the 12 for all the improvements in modems, screen and the camera.And boy was I surprised . Let‚Äôs take up the review in sections.1. Screen: Having used a high refresh rate screen of OP8 before, I was quite sceptical about the 60hz of iPhone12 before I bought it. But, astonishingly, the iPhone12 screen is buttery smooth, courtesy of the high touch sampling rate and excellent animations. This does not feel like a 60hz display, and I cannot stress this enough. The display is EXCELLENT .2. Camera: being a photographer who has spent half of his life travelling, I prioritise a good camera over anything else. And these are surely the most spectacular cameras that I have used on a smartphone. Excellent HDR, great details and very post processing friendly. Of course, the video is as good as it gets on a phone. Attaching some images I shot on the 12 for your reference. Trust me when I say this, you could use this for some semi professional shoot just fine, if it‚Äôs only for social media and you are not printing really big.3. Battery: Battery on this device is not spectacular, it‚Äôs average. It will get you through the day for sure, unless you are in very long video calls two three times a day. It is good enough, on par with my OnePlus.4. Build Quality: this is where it is head and shoulders above the competition. Rock solid, an led weirdly lightweight, this feels very, very premium.5. Software: iOS 14 and the iOS15 have really pushed the sub par experience of ios11 away, and this software now feels smoother than ever. Great improvements. Excellent software experience, not something I could say with my XR.Summary: Excellent device, with no complains. This could really be one of the first devices that I used which I can call perfect. Highly recommended."

380,Amazon Customer,How to decide between iPhone 11 and 12,4.0,"After thinking a lot, I decided to go ahead with iPhone 12. The original price is ‚Çπ 84900. After credit card discount(‚Çπ6000), old phone exchange(‚Çπ3450) and reward points money(‚Çπ4530) inclusion, I bought it for ‚Çπ70920. There‚Äôs also an additional 3000 discount on red and white variants but I couldn‚Äôt let go of blue1. PRICE: Considering iPhone 11 would be supported by iOS for 4 years, based on the current price it‚Äôd cost 13k per year and iPhone 12 for 5 years would cost 14.9k(excluding exchange discount) per year. For me price gap for both phones didn‚Äôt seem to make a huge difference as IPhone 11 is already an year old and costing only a 2k less per year.2: DISPLAY: I‚Äôve purchased iPhone 11 for my mom last year and been observing the display for some months. Compared to iPhone 11, the iPhone 12 display is far superior and has better pixel quality.3: BEZELS: the bezels of iPhone 12 are much thinner and makes the phone look decent unlike in 11. Apart from this, the phone is incredibly light making it easy to hold it.How to choose between 64/128gb:If you‚Äôre not really tight on budget, I‚Äôd suggest to go for 128gb variant. I‚Äôve been using one plus for 1.5 years and storage  occupied about 60gb. So it‚Äôd make good sense to check your current phone usage. Either way you can also opt for iCloud 50gb storage which would cost approximately the difference amount of 64 and 128 go for 5 years.CONS:1. Could have definitely included the charger for the price2. If you‚Äôre an android user, migration would be little time consumingUpdate: I‚Äôve uploaded a couple of pictures shot using automatic night mode. :)"

Who would have been responsible?Who would have paid for my loss ?If you are ordering expensive items , make sure to capture the video and ask delivery guy to open before submitting OTP..With god's grace i have received my phone.

490,GARIKAPATI DUSHYANTH,I miss my OnePlus 6,5.0,"Android v/s iOSPro Apple1. Tons of privacy features and solid implementation. Every new app installed needs permission to send notifications.And with a future update, facebook won't be able to track what you're doing in other apps outside of Facebook. This deserves an applaud. 2. BatteryThe battery is amazing, giving more than 6 hours of screen on time. OnePlus can't touch this. If you bring this up with them, they'll distract you by saying it has fast charging.3. Camera - photos are ok and decent BUT, DAMN, the video quality is amazing. Totally stabilized ready for uploads.4. Build Quality - SOLID.5. Continued updates for years and years. An android may last you 2-4 years, and the updated would be ""raam bharose"", but these new iphones especially will easily last 5 years minimum with no compromises on software and security upgrades.6. Less features, but they work 10/10. Example, auto fill OTP option in keyboard works every single timein iPhone. In Android, if your keyboard is open already before the otp arrives, then this feature won't work. Half baked implementation.Pro Android / Anti - iOS1. Notifications. Notifications centre on iPhone SUCKS. I have missed email notifications regularly. Android does this so well.2. Implementation of new app library feature sucks. This creates a very confusing situation. The way to solve this would be if the auto-folders in app library could be manually managed.3. Screen Sizes and Notch - The Notch is a disgrace for iphones when the iphones have reached the level of punch hole displays. Hoping the next year's model can make it better.4. No Truecaller in iPhone and no call recording. I can forgive the call recording considering the privacy first model, but truecaller is a pro to privacy.5. CHEAP QUALITY OF CHARGING CABLE. For a luxury brand, this is a disgrace.6. PRICE - Yes, iphones are expensive BUT, paying +10-15k for a phone available cheaper in Dubai / USA really pinches. Damn Taxes.7. Yes iPhones run smoothly but don't think that these don't stutter. I face very light stutters now and then and I restart at least once a week whenever I encounter it.I'll probably give this phone to my family member against their iPhone x since they're way too deep in ios ecosystem now."

510,Yaswanth S.,Best selling phone in the world!!!,3.0,"No wonder Apple makes some of the best phones in the world. Iphone 12 deservedly is the highest selling phone.I was upgrading from iphone 7 which served me well for 4 years, which I exchanged for this.The delivery & exchange formalities were smooth.The phone itself is surely an upgrade when compared to 7, the display is top notch, the camera is probably the best there is, the face unlock works like a charm, what's to say about the best phone, it works even better than advertised.The only problem like always is the battery which hardly lasts a day & charging time is also an issue, it tends to heat up a little while charging but with the previous experience with iphone 7, the longevity of the phone is guaranteed with the timely updates from Apple, the premium which an iphone demands stands justified with a superior product.Some people tried to discourage me from buying an iphone from Amazon claiming warranty & support issues. But there's no substance to such things. I confirmed the warranty & product registration from Apple, it's as advertised.Since most of us are going to use it for a longer period of time, it's prudent to opt for the extended warranty offered by Apple which costs around 16500 which gives us an extended year of warranty. Do remember to do this within 3 months of your purchase."

535,surya prakash,Apple should wait for at least 2 years before launching a new iPhone.,4.0,"Well they are a multinational conglomerate and I have simply purchased a product of theirs, so I shouldn‚Äôt be commenting on their product launching strategy. However keeping this aside, I would try to genuinely help those looking for reviews before buying, in a few simple steps.1. Go for it if you are going for an upgrade after  3-4 years, as it will give you some flawless experience again.2. Battery life is not upto the mark, I feel XR that I used before this had a good battery, maybe I am wrong.3. Face ID has got no significant improvement at all, again I think XR had a better face detection.4. Camera I could sense something has been done.5. Coming to interface and product performance, it is flawless, smooth, faster."

I have to use different charging cables for my iPhone, while my iPad Pro, Samsung Buds etc share a USB C cable.2) Some advertised features require the support of additional devices of Apple Eco System. For example, Apple said with iOS 15.3 face ID will work even with Masks On. But I just learned that this feature works only if you have an iWatch also.3) Not a gamer, but still for this price point at least a 90Hz refresh was desirable.4) Front Camera, sometimes have not of noise (nitpicking)At the end of the day, I am happy with my purchase. But I strongly recommend this phones to enthusiasts and upgraders only."

I have had the X before and OnePlus 6T as well.Overall experience of switching to iOS again is so good. The Interface, the speed, smoothness, camera, support, and everything is so well crafter.I‚Äôll be talking about the pros and cons with respect to the apple standards of course.Pros:1. The design is absolutely wonderful, its very very light weight and premium feeling phone with vintage boxy look.2. The speed, the performance.3. Camera of course. The normal picture comes out pretty good, they don‚Äôt usually need any professional touch.4. Battery life - I‚Äôll talk about the battery life in day to day life instead of nerdy Screen On Time. I am a doctor and usually don‚Äôt play much games on this but I surf web a lot, youtube videos, social media and a lot of WhatsApp and sometimes heavy use for 10% of the time. It can get through one day pretty easily with around 8-9 hr Screen on time, 10hr Stand by time, so you can relate now. Don‚Äôt believe that it has bad battery, it has a pretty good battery.ConsNothing much until now.The back of the phone is fingerprint magnet, attracts a lot of them.Another concern was the charging adapter which is not provided in the box."
564,Yaswanth S.,perfect,3.0,everything is good about this phone. But the battery life is a bit less but it‚Äôs apple product so nobody cares about the battery life although it charges quickly only with the apple charger you buy separately and the battery life is enough for daily use but it drains quickly if you play high end games.
565,Charan,Great phone. Prices in India not so great,1.0,Battery life is good. Great display. Point and shoot is always good on iphones. Phone has all that you need.Prices is always high and we still buy like fools and to top it we dont get earphones nor the power brick.The last thing is we do not get quality military standard drop protective cases which is the worst thing its nothing related to phone but good to know info. Even if you get they are some of the worst ones and price is atleast three time more compared to the original product price.And if your buying Apple warranty you will keep draining your money as they have the worst support. They only believe in replacements and I am sure its not worth it to pay 18k for an year.

567,Vikram tiwari,Moving from Android to iOS?,1.0,"Yes, it is a 5 star phone. But if you are moving from android to iPhone please be ready to lose your freedom. There is a lot available on internet to tell you about what you will lose out on. It is like speaking a new language altogether.Quick image editing, video editing, simple things like making collages, setting custom ringtones, quick editing of alarms, changing WiFi or Bluetooth, toggling location, many more basic features are either absent in iOS or managed in a very cumbersome way. You will miss them if moving from Andriod. Also be ready to lose your WhatsApp chat history. Not impressed by the sound reproduction on bigger speakers via Bluetooth and the very inflexible equilizer.For some silly reasons Apple is being stubborn on some aspects like standardisation of charging cable even within its own products. The notch at the top of the screen is still the same size it was in 2018.Rest, there are tons of reviews to praise the phone and I agree with most of them.Was a bit disappointed the way it was packaged. No foam or bubble wrap."

I was using the Xr and 11 before this and though of upgrading.1. If you are moving from an android to iPhone for the 1st time, its a great phone to get in terms of camera, processor, screen quality. But if you are already an existing iPhone user, upgrade only from XR downwards. That is if your are upgrading from a 8/X/XS/XR. If you have a 11, stick to it. Wait for the 13 or budget is not a constraint then get the 12 pro.2. form factor. Apple has gone back to rectangle brick design that they used in their earlier phones. Now for me this was one the reasons I didn't like the phone. It wasn't comfortable n the hand after being used to the curve of the X and 11 and XR3. Camera- best camera quality with night mode . u can't go wrong with this camera setup.4. screen- excellent screen quality , no complaints here.5. 5g - IS it really that big a deal breaker ? especially if you are in India where 5g seems a long way off.6. No charging adapter. You either have to connect it to your MacBook or buy a separate power adapter. When ur spending 70 odd grand, that's the least apple could offer.7. again no ear phones.8. It somehow doesn't have the wow factor as what the X had.Update.I exchange my phone for a 12 mini. much more easier to use with one hand and comfortable."

The phone is a gesture hell. Do not ever give it to a senior citizen, they deserve one more sensitive. The simplicity of back button in android here is played by  oversmartness of gestures and contextual back button which at times gets lost. Intuitive keyboard is nowhere near swiftkey in android. Even physical design is poorly thought, the volume up button is bang opposite power button making one accidentally press both to take an unwarranted screen shot. Battery life is as good or bad as any standard phone. Ever since i switched over to iphone, life is worse. Great hardware and system,poor arrogant design"

My OP7 was smooth, fast had good battery camera,battery and  haptics. iPhone is just way smoother,fast and have great camera,battery and haptics. There is a slight learning curve. took 2 days to get used to gestures and navigations but is smooth sailing. the only negative feedback would be no charger in the box.

Airplay doesn't always work in non native apps. WiFi in beginning had trouble connecting sometimes.Pros:No bloatwareGreat security, even installing a new app or system update requires face I'd or pin.Good for special needs people they get lot of tools to help usage like voice control, which is others can use to coz its handy.Silent physical switch left side of the iphone.Imovie for making videos.Face Id works in mask.Google provides 15 gb cloud storage but apple just 5 gbEssentially you're paying for the software"

792,Yaswanth S.,Great product,3.0,"I was skeptical ordering iPhone from amazon, however when I received it was perfect."
793,Aziz khatri,iPhone is like a Shadi ka Ladoo,5.0,"I was an Android user and had high hopes with this Apple gadget, however after 8 months of using this so hyped Apple device, I can finally say that an iPhone is similar to a Shadi ka ladoo ‚Äî jo Khaaye wo pachtaaye aur jo na khaye wo bhi pachtaaye. The reason I am saying this is because this phone lacks even the most basic features that even a 5k android phone has, like - call recording - which I eventually realised that it should have been an Apple feature instead of third party apps - which demand money and are pretty inconvenient to use.The second drawback is that call logs are auto erased and kept up to a certain stack size (100 / 102) and if you want to go back to pull any earlier call logs beyond this specified stack size, you won‚Äôt be able to do so and will have to rely on your network provider (if you are eligible) for the same.These are two very ground level use cases that fail to deliver in an Apple device and since I faced real life situations surrounding these two scenarios I feel that I it is not worth having this Phone and better to keep your ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù pants on.Then I thought why I bought this phone in the first place and got my answer - 1. Camera ??Android phones are easily  competing nicely with iPhone Camera now-a-days and some have even better camera.2. Brand marketing / re-selling value / durability ?? I am so over it now after 8 months of usage and the price keeps on sinking down as newer model enters the market so not a wise call I must sayFinal outcome:Definitely not a returning customer."

Please buy cable separately, if needed.The selfie camera dulls the skin tone. Selfies taken via Androids look better.Here's my 2 cents:I'm using it as a secondary phone with OnePlus 8 as my primary.Please use your discretion.Thanks."

Else, of you want iphone for show off You can buy this Product. It will give full day battery backup on Normal Usages. Camera quality is also Good.

¬†Apple bhi hang hota hai?I spent 68000 for apple and this mobile going hang some time.When i visit service centre Ambuja Mall Raipur CG he told me it take 3 hrs to update firmware if not solved it take 10 day for Banglore service centre. That means i am suffering for 10 day.Better you purchase Two android mobile if one have problem you use other.I heared apple give replacement on hanging problem but he denied.So finaly Apple iphone waste of money."

I received one faulty product which didn't turned on when I received the product.So first I reached to customer service officer to report this issue. And my experience was utterly disappointing. Never expected such thing from Amazon.First some one told me to visit Apple store to collect  job sheet or diagnostic report. So I visited Apple service centre collected the same and they confirmed that the product is faulty. There was hardware issue.So after receiving that report when I tried to reach the customer service officer they denied the fact and said only Apple can do the replacement not Amazon. Then when I asked share one copy of that terms and conditions over mail they failed to do that as well. Not at all helpful behaviour and filled with wrong information.So much disappointment. I feel there is lack of communication and training which is resulting into suffer for customers. Highly frustrated
1075,Pinky kumari,Don‚Äôt switch from Android Flagships,5.0,"Switched from S20FE ( S865). Not worth it. Only switched for the size.Never expected iPhones to be so buggy.

Upon getting the service report done from Apple service centre the support team staff Mr. Sanjay on outright basis denied replacment stating we cant issue basis the report. It's the brand who will have to be contacted. Customer service and support is clearly lacking with a brand like Amazon. What's the point of claiming of a free 7 day replacement policy when the support team clearly twists it as per their own convenience. I have had a experience of lifetime and would highly recommend no one to buy from Amazon. They are best at not helping consumers whatsover.  #patheticpolicies #poorcustomerservice"

But even after updating there was no improvement so called apple support spoke to then at length about my situation and after hearing me they did some troubleshooting and came to a conclusion that it has some hardware problem and should approach Amazon as they were responsible for selling me this product for replacement.  by this time 7 days completed and according to the Amazon policy they only return and replace for 7 days.  When spoke to Amazon customer care they just wouldn't connect me to the concern department they just bluntly say I should approach apple but apple executive tells me he can't do anything. Is this how you treat a loyal customer you can check my account the and frequency I order trough Amazon. Not even connecting call to the concern department.

¬†Battery backup is worst. My 2 year old redmi note7 pro (12k) easily runs one  full day with more than 4 hour screen on time. But this new 60k phone almost dies with 2 hour Amazon music. Clearly not worth it. Apart from the 12mp ultra wide camera nothing else is impressive in this comparing to my old phone.  Updated to the latest iOS version. Running in low power mode. Still battery is draining. Since the replacement period is over, totally devastated. To conclude never buy an iPhone ever again. In video Battery charged to 96%.

¬†Another beauty from Apple. I was upgraded from iPhone X and it was great experience with all the latest specs and flawlessly smooth. Thanks to all new A14 Bionic chip.Build quality was great as always from Apple.Phone feels light on hands due to aluminium body. I chose Blue colour because wanted to go for different colour than routine Black and white iPhones so initially I was bit skeptical but after seeing the phone in person I‚Äôm happy with the blue colour  ‚Äú not bad at all and not too flashy‚ÄùGrip and feel perfect. Phone comes with iOS 14.1. Camera quality was excellent and sufficient  as a normal user.If you are from iOS ecosystem nothing will go wrong here.There is nothing to question about the quality and interface from Apple ( it‚Äôs my personal opinion as a long time apple user)As you all know iPhone 12 won‚Äôt comes with earphones and charging brick( adapter)I bought separately 20w apple adapter from new Apple India online store for Rs.1900I don‚Äôt judge here apple because of accessories removal and the price tag. I hope apple can justify this.I only hope and wanted to see so badly Made in India IPhones so that we all can enjoy lower priced ( at least a better priced) iPhones in the future.A big thanks to Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd and Amazon for delivering genuine iPhone as always in perfect condition. Delivered way before the promised date.Update: (01/12/2020) After testing 25 days especially on battery life of this iPhone 12, results were amazing and I‚Äôm completely satisfied  with the battery performance. On Moderate gaming, Moderate Video Content, heavy on calls and heavy on browsing this iPhone 12 battery life is sufficient for your regular Day.My conclusion is definitely a better and improved battery performer than the previous iPhone model.Thank you Apple IndiaThank you Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd.Thank you Amazon India.( Note: charger brick was shown in my video was bought myself from Apple India online store because it won‚Äôt comes with the phone)"

1874,Yaswanth S.,Very good phone with bit overpriced,3.0,"Although i have purchased from retail ..but the device performance is excellant.. I used to upgrade from XR to 12..and significantly notices the difference in viewing angle aspect as well as day to day use.. As per power management  stat after using 17 hrs, 20 percent battery left .. camera is flawless in daylight/ artificial lighting also superb night mode.. you can see the picture of white flowers taken in night mode.. Although i thought there will be no major difference in XR and 12 display, but it matters!!! You can observ the difference while viewing any high resolution and colourful content. Stereo sound improvment also found from my previous device.. But altough it is bit overpriced.. But any i phone user planning to upgrade from it‚Äôs older siblings he will not be disappointed and will enjoy the one handed opearation"

1917,Abhishek,Beast,4.0,Beast....Ever...Don‚Äôt Trust Other Brand Plastics..Really worthable product from AppleThe Originallity and the Quality Ever from appleTrust
1918,Yaswanth S.,Better than androids almost in every category.,3.0,"This is my 1st iPhone after using androids for 10 years. I have started my android journey with Samsung galaxy S1 and after that HTC, ASUS, LG, many MI (including Mi3, first Xiaomi product in India) and since last 3 years 3 galaxy Latest series. To me camera is the most important feature for a mobile after making and taking calls. I was keen to buy S21 but felt apart from ultra other two are nothing special even not so premium like earlier galaxy series. By this time I broke my S20 plus and thinking for one plus 9pro but was not very happy with camera output, even lots of people are complaining about 888 chipset, and then I had only one choice it‚Äôs iPhone, I was very much in dilemma as it‚Äôs totally different OS with many restrictions. But somehow because of the camera I thought to give it a try, and man after 1 month I feel this is the best phone in the market. Other manufacturers must learn what‚Äôs called optimisation, that tinny battery can last for almost complete one working day, google apps work better than android, games work flawlessly . And safety and privacy is in different league, I can choose whether I‚Äôll allow the app to track my use or not, Xiaomi are you listening??? And camera is surely best if you want to exact colour and white balance. Only disappointments are , WhatsApp chat can‚Äôt be transfer from android, Truecaller doesn‚Äôt work properly, and the Ugly big notch, common apple we know you brought this screen to body ratio concept but this notch needs to be removed."
1919,Abhishek,Stupidity of buying iPhone,4.0,I encourage people not to buy this. Because they are bullying you by their big name. The cost of the phone is no doubt high but without a charger is simply stupidity. I don't why people buy this when there are lots of options available with best features in other company. I am not ruthless atball towards iPhone brand but atleast the device should come with a charger with free of cost. Now a days iPhone is driving people who are actually stupid.
1920,Yaswanth S.,From iphone 6 to iphone 12,3.0,"I was using iphone 6 from past 5-6 years and this is my first upgrade after a while,Pros.1. Overall look2. Screensize(kind of perfect)3. Sound quality(love it)4. Fast processor(come on!)5. And the biggest improvement was battery life( note that i was using iphone 6)It is a big imporvement in terms of battery life, if you are coming from iphone 6, 6s or 7 or even iphone 86. Camera is obviously great on iphoneCons.1. Battery should be of bigger size( as people tend to use iphone for around 2-3 years, i am exception, i used my iphone 6 for around 5-6 years with 3 times battery replacement!üòõ2. Should have included the charger as commonly people dont have apple type c charger in their house)3. Other than these two things everything is perfect.Noted:The notch doesnt significantly have any sort of trouble while using it!(actually you wont even noticed it.)*I would suggest to go for iphone 12 rather than 12 pro series, only the difference is of steel body and one extra camera!same spec. same processor, same battery... everything is same!Why would you pay extra 40k for just the steel body and extra camera!(the picture quality is same)Choice is yours!‚úåüèª"
1921,Abhishek,More Reasonable Now.,4.0,"If you know where to look, you can find this phone for fifty two for the sixty four version. My review is based on that pricing as I got my father one of those just yesterday and here is what i have noticed.PROS -a) Great build quality, very light phone. After using an 11pro max and a 13pro max this size is so much easier to behold and a lot easier without bells and whistles.b) Good Camera set up - you will get two options, normal and zoom out. Both are clear and perfectly adequate.c) Nice loud speakersd) Oled Display - not the best display but this was apple's foray into a non-pro phone with OLED display and it was a very successful onee) Software - Apple software is great and the processor is speedy.f) Great voice quality and good signal - again somehting to behold and cherish.g) Face ID is supe fasth) Speedy now and speedy after 3 years also.CONS -Some may think this is expensive (but please note after 2 years you will still be able to get half of the value in return. That is something only Apple does well so cost of ownership works out to around 1000 a month)Feels very flimsy and insubstantial without case owing to less weightNo finger print scanner. Apple support is terrible.OPTIONS - If you want to go for an android i recommend the fan edition version of Samsungs, a one plus 9pro or a pixel 4a. The pixel 4a is best value. The one plus is good for photos but video is not even as good as an iPhone 8. Apple has best video in class across the last 3 years."

1925,Abhishek,No innovation yet and still expensive is not so fair strategy,4.0,"My redmi k20 pro performs way better in terms of performance, battery & camera when compared with this iphone 12. Just you need to use Google camera apk in your k20 pro to experience much better quality of camera than stock app. Bad apple strategy to sell anything at any price.

1948,Yaswanth S.,Battery issue,3.0,Waste of money display quality also poor and battery is very worst than iphone 11 pls dont buy it and waste your money
1949,Abhishek,Good product...only if you are going to keep it for 5-6 years,4.0,"Buy good product one or two years after launch and use it for atleast 5-6 years. This way you get complete worth of the money you spend....Half a lakh rupee is surely big money. Try saving half a lakh rupee or try earning half a lakh rupee with honest work then we  understand the effort we put in earning. So for any normal people it is utter waste of money if people are upgrading phones or any tech every year (unless you are having lots of black money or free money).Here is a small advice - buy good brand product after 1-2 years of launch. This way you pay less to good product. Now that you have purchased good product, use that product for atleast 5-6 years. This way you get complete worth of the money you spend on product.There is no pride in owning a latest and greatest tech that either sits in our pocket or in our backpack (laptops) every 6 months or 1 year. Youtuber make money by talking great about every product launched daily. It's their way of making living. Instead of tv commercials companies are using YouTubers to sell their product. So don't waste money on tech like smartphones, tablets, laptops or whatever every 6 months to 1 year.If company say we improved camera that is not a good enough reason to upgrade and make companies rich. This type of consumers are helping companies to make profit without offering genuine new tech. Tell me what value does a higher mega pixel camera add ? To take photos you have to travel and to travel you need money. If you are not travelling anywhere what photos will you take or what memories will you capture.Think of current crises in society. Consumerism has succeeded in keeping people poor and making them dumb. Owning costly phones frequently upgrading will never make you rich nor make you feel good for long time. Life is not about smartphone upgrade. Tech products are bare essentials and not life style.Be sensible in your purchases. Save money. Dont make upgrade your lifestyle. There are lot of better and worthy experiences that can bring long term happiness. In the end its these non consumerism experiences you value.most and miss most. Ex - you will be more sorry in the end that you could not travel, see places, meet interesting people, built a stable simple life and that you spent all your hard earned fortune in upgrading tech products frequently.Frequent tech upgrade is not life..."
1950,Yaswanth S.,Beauty + Beast,3.0,"I have been an Android power user for 12+ years having used over 6 high end devices. I have enjoyed using every android device and was super comfortable having full control over Android OS/ecosystem (highly customizable options).iPhone 12 or rather iOS is in entirety a different world altogether. Simple, elegant, amazingly powerful, rich features and fully secure. iPhone 12 is a stunning beauty with a beastly performance. Simply put - iPhone 12 is vivacious, curvaceous, elegant, attractive and just feels so good. It's design is impeccable and purple of all looks super stunning.Now for the specs:1) A14 Bionic Chip: First chip in the smartphone industry built on a 5-nanometer process for performance and efficiency improvements. The 6-core CPU and 4-core GPU in the A14 is 50 percent faster than the fastest competing smartphone chips. Also includes a 16-core Neural Engine that offers an 80 percent increase in performance for machine learning tasks2) Camera: 27 percent more light for better performance in low-light conditions along with 2x optical zoom and 5x digital zoom. The photos are just brilliant, even in low light conditions. This iPhone can capture 30fps HDR video with Dolby Vision, enabling cinema-grade videos. For video fanatics this iPhone offers 4K HDR video recording3) Display: 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display / 2532x1170 resolution. It's a treat to watch videos on this iPhone. It's lively & pixel perfect.4) Battery: Well, this one is a slight bummer. Yes, much depends on your daily usage but overall it's pretty good.5) Security/Privacy: iOS is a closed ecosystem which gives less control to developers. This is the single biggest edge iOS has. Their review systems for developer is a cut above the rest. Though iPhones are vulnerable to hackers/viruses the chances are minimal because of their exhaustive sec measures6) Design: I love the new design of the iPhone 12. In addition to being smaller and lighter, it has flat sides and a flat screen.The iPhone 13 still doesn't cut above iPhone 12 in many aspects. I believe iPhone 12 is still the best smartphone until the launch of iPhone 14 (if some real tangible features & not just settling for some minor tweaks). Though it's been a full 1 year since it's launch, iPhone 12 is very much worth buying."
1951,Abhishek,IPhone 12 review-sindhuja Badigineni,4.0,"The iPhone 12 is the fanciest smart phone in the market currently. The iPhone is assembled with great care and caution so as to successfully meet the evolving customer needs. In order to demonstrate Apple‚Äôs commitment to meeting the needs of its consumers, this paper provides a product review of the IPhone 12.This phone costs ‚Çπ72,999 but it is worth the price.  First of all, the IPhone 12 has a beautiful design. Many customers are concerned about how their phone looks. Unlike other phones that do not address this need, IPhone has an aesthetic feel. The IPhone 12 is also lighter compared to many other phone models (McFedries 12). This means that the phone is easy to carry both in the pocket and by hand. The weight of the phone matters because in many cases, heavier phones face the risk of dropping to the floor in case one is multitasking while handling the phone. In addition, it is sometimes uncomfortable to carry a heavy phone in the pocket because it often wears off due to the heavy weight. In addition to the light weight that characterizes the iPhone 12, it is important to understand that the phone has a higher speed in terms of internet connection and detection compared to other phones and the IPhone 11 model. This means that consumers will be able to enjoy the fast internet as they surf the internet. Considering the growing need for accessing the internet in daily activities such as social media, iPhone 12 is an ideal phone to possess.  In addition to faster internet and Wi-Fi the iPhone 12 has a great GPS and location service (Cohen 31).This means that there is no need for purchasing a GPS if one possesses an iPhone 12. This shows that the iPhone12 is cost effective because one can save money for gadgets such as a GPS because the iPhone12 provides the same service. In addition to the GPS, the iPhone 12 can store large quantities of data, especially music. With an iPhone 12 one does not have to purchase an iPod for the purposes of listening to music. One can either save music directly on the iPhone12 or use a memory card to save music. In addition to music, the iPhone 12 has an excellent camera. The neatness of the pictures taken using the iPhone 12 is greater than other phones such as Android models and the iPhone 11. It is also important to note that the iPhone 12 provides a wide range of photo editing software compared to other phones in the market. Therefore, in addition to saving money that would be used to buy a GPS, one can also save money that could be used to buy a camera. The iPhone 12 also comes with excellent ringtones that can be assigned to each caller in the phone contacts. This is a characteristic that is not available in many phone models and those phones that have the service do not have nice ringtones.  In addition to the software component of the iPhone 12, it is important to note that this phone's battery is long-lasting (Kelby & White 29). This means that the iPhone 12 can be able to stay charged for a longer time compared to many other phone models. For example, Android phones are known to drain their charge in a short period. Therefore, if one is looking for a phone that has a long battery life, the iPhone 12 is the ideal phone to purchase"
1952,Yaswanth S.,Service Woes....Defective product combined with Poor Service...read on......,3.0,"Given a 1 Star as Apple continues to sell a defective product without resolving reported issues worldwideBeware: Buy at your own LUCK. This is solely based on my 2 months of experience with a defective iPhone12 128GB purchased from Amazon.Part I - The Rise of 'iPhone'The Saga began with an aspiration to buy a quality iPhone, feedback was that it never hangs....but wait no one told me that it won't hang till it works . This came as a gift to me from my wife, seeing my aspiration, she also got inspired and jumped the Gun to buy it on my birthday......But none of us imagined the nightmare it will become if you got yourself a defective piece. Don't believe me, search for ""iPhone 12 non-responsive screen"". You will get heartburns reading how many of them have non-responsive screens and have not worked even after replacement of whole phone itself, one guy had it replaced 3 times but issue kept coming back.It seems iPhone 12 is a defective buildAfter approx 15-20 days I started seeing same issue of phone unlocking(face unlock) but then nothing used to work on the touch screen. You are effectively not able to walk past the unlocked screen.If you locked and unlocked again, touch screen would start functioning till the next time it would behave in the same manner. I installed the apple support app to diagnose the issue and luckily the touchscreen issues went away without any trace.But wait, I wasnt so lucky, the same issue crept back exactly on the 54th day but this time with a vengeance, the phone simply wouldn't unlock no matter what you do. You can see the screen, it would charge and reboot and all that . Now began the nightmare which is the Part II.Part II - The Phantom(iPhone service) menace- No direct way to contact India customer support, only through chat and they will do an automated call back- First they tell me the usual workarounds, press button A, B, C etc etc. which I have already tried, standard procedures eating up so much time- Next after frustrating 30 min call with them, they send me instructions over email to take backup and do a factory restore(ignoring the fact that the touch screen isnt working)- As expected cannot take backup using itunes due to the PIN which requires your touch screen to work, frustrations are on the peak.- Now I reach back to support and they are trying to get me an appointment with the nearest service center, their service locator app is not working and I am scheduled a call back.- I wait at the designated schedule but I get a mail that I am not reachable, wait....my number is pre-fixed with a +91 and the automated call back is also adding another +91......shikes I will never get a call back.- Now I try to reach out to them, with the frustrations at the peak, didn't want to talk to them so started a chat session and luckily got the appointment with them in the next hour.- Reached the Service center, they asked me to wait, diagnosed and found that the iphone screen is not responsive, have to seek guidance from Apple.- After a week of checking online status which didnt change, I called the service center and asked for status. I am told that they are waiting for parts from Apple. I told them I am not interested, either replace the whole handset or refund the money.-I am provided Apple support number to talk to, as it a decision that has to come from Apple.- I immediately call Apple support and have a long conversation of over 45 minutes in which they are defiant to replace the handset and insist that they provide quality repair in India which after repairs will be like new only.- I offer them this ""NEW"" repaired phone and to give me my money back. I also state that in the USA, they replace and in INDIA is a repair, to which I am given an answer that every region has a different policy.....how discriminatory.- The call ends after 45 minutes of strong discussions that I will evaluate the quality of repair and then only accept the phone back. But with still no change in status on their site, I am not sure if they even know what to do with these screen issues on iPhonePart III - The Empire Strikes Back- For many days apple service did not have a clue on whats happening except for waiting for Apple to respond- After multiple followups and posts on twitter, got some attention- Repaired phone(not acceptable) was returned after 13 days with chassis replaced- Poor service for one of ""the"" expensive phones on this planet, Apple has taken Indian customers for granted. I am sure they would have replaced the phone immediately in US.BAD overall experience, has spoiled the product ownership experience forever."
1953,Abhishek,Misleading picture and wrong Product Information,4.0,"Looks like the phone has two vertical lenses and the case has an additional lens, covering the flash of the mobile! Curious to know what this new technology is..."

1955,Abhishek,The iPhone (again) with an OLED display,4.0,"While the iPhone 11 is an amazing device, without doubt, yet it has an IPS display. Older iPhone X and iPhone XS had OLED displays. Apple returned to OLED again with iPhone 12, although the refresh rate is at 60Hz. For those, who have not used devices with 90Hz or 120Hz, you would not notice any differences. Moving from an older iPhone with IPS display to iPhone 12, and you would immediately notice the crisp blacks. Battery size physically is less than the iPhone 11, yet Apple tweaks the A14 Bionic coupled with the iOS, which easily stretches the charge for 10-12hrs. on regular usage. Those heavily into web browsing, gaming etc. may not have such a long run with a single charge, yet it is capable enough for a pretty long day, without the need to plug in to the outlet. Oh, and yes, iPhone 12 comes with a USB-C to Lightning cable, but no charger. You will need to get a USB-C charger separately, either from Apple or other brands. Else, you can use your Qi charger, if you have one already.iPhone 12 also has a more boxy look, a throwback to the iconic iPhone 4 days. Overall, as with any Apple phone, it is an amazing device, if you use your smartphone for all the regular usage like apps, gaming, web browsing. And yes, it can send messages. Oh, forgot, it can make and receive calls too, quite well!"

1977,Abhishek,AVOID AMAZON FOR APPLE PRODUCTS!,4.0,"Strongly recommend DO NOT BUY any apple products either airpods, ipads, mac, iphone or even apple pencil or charger from Amazon! Because even after the ""7 days replacement"" note on the seller or the product page, Amazon not gonna provide you a straight simple easy-going replacement at your door step.No matter what ever product you've received, duplicate or broken or even a empty box....They gonna straight send you to the service centre & after that service centre will guide you further! Amazon call it ""apple products policy"" they never mention! & You have to visit the service centre & collect documentation & whatever needed in between the replacement policy days!Remember service centre always tries to repair the product.& Even after that you not gonna have a straight easy refund!!When you finally have to visit the service centre for a return policy even if you get a duplicate or defective product, which not gonna happen from your home, then why to buy it from online & not from a retail store!?"
1978,Yaswanth S.,"don't go with blue for 12 series, it feels cheap. Go for white or black.they feels super cool",3.0,"Its the mini that I always wanted. Its the most compact phone with that massive power...You can do literally everything that an regular iPhone pro or max models can do(except few exclusive pro features). This is an iPhone so one should not expect something that android offers.You don't get 6000-7000mah battery or 144hz or 108 mp camera or something like these....But except the battery life(obviously you should not expect from this tiny phone), this offer almost everything one can expect from iPhone.But there are some issues that keeps changing with some buggy software updates like 1.Battery issue, 2.Heating Issue (it is permanent has not been fixed yet),3.Some ecosystem sync issue like call drops while receiving from your mac etc.but these doesn't affect my use cases much...but be aware,1) If you are a heavy gamer, its a beast but it feels hungry soon so keep your charger nearby,2) While gaming, you can notice significant dimming issue that might be a deal breaker."
